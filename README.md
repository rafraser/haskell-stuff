# Haskell Projects
### also some Elm stuff now too
This repository is a small assortment of functional programming projects.

These projects are relatively simple, and designed primarily for me to become more familiar with functional programming

## Project Information
| Project Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| helloworld | A very basic program, mostly made to learn about setting up project structures with Cabal |
| euler | A brief collection of solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems |
| mandelbrot | My personal "Hello World" program: rendering the Mandelbrot Set! This uses [HIP](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hip) to render an image of the fractal |
| opengl | Experiments with OpenGL shaders using Haskell for linking and visualisation |
| serving | My first Elm project, using Servant as a backend server |

For more information about each project, see the README in each project directory
