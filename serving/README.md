# Serving
This project is my entrance into the complicated world of full-stack web development with functional programming

### Process
- Install Servant with Cabal
- Cabal sucks, install Servant with Stack instead
- Make the simple Servant webserver program
- Everything breaks when compiling it because I made the build files wrong
- Learn Elm and write the frontend

### Reflection
Overall, this project taught me a lot about managing dependencies and builds with Haskell - definitely useful knowledge for the future. This is also my first Elm project - while I'm not happy with the style, I'm happy with how nicely the program works so far! I'm excited to work more with Elm going forward.
