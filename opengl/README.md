# OpenGL Experiments
This is some basic code focused on experimenting with OpenGL shaders.
Main.hs is run with an argument specifying which shader name to load - it then loads the appropriate fragment and vertex shaders.

Currently created GLSL shaders:
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| test | Renders a basic gradient |
| mandelbrot | Fast rendering of the Mandelbrot set |
